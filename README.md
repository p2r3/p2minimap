## Browser-based Portal 2 minimap experiment
Sister project of [HTTPortal](https://github.com/p2r3/HTTPortal). Well, technically, this is the prequel. A very rough prototype.

For setup instructions, see [the HTTPortal README](https://github.com/p2r3/HTTPortal/blob/main/README.md). Otherwise, you know how the license files usually say "this software is provided as-is with no warranty" and so on? Well, this _really_ is provided _completely_ as-is, without any documentation or code comments.
